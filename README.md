# Roadmap

### QR Breadcrumbs

Planning and Task Management

#### Week 1 - Touching Base

- [x] Touch base and assess project needs
- [x] Research new room traversal algorithms

#### Week  2 - Drafting Solution

- [x] Decide on a new room traversal algorithm
- [x] Write a proposal for this method ( QR Breadcrumbs )

#### Week 3 - Breaking Ground

- [ ] Create object structure of iOS application 
- [ ] Assess required libraries and dependancies for the project
- [ ] Execute mock Breadcrumbs on the Roomba

#### Week 4 - Giving Sight

- [ ] Print up some physical mock Breadcrumbs for machine vision testing
- [ ] Begin work on machine vision solution for detecting QR Codes

#### Week 5 - Seeing Farther

- [ ] Implement a way to view QR Codes at an angle looking down and ahead 
- [ ] Implement a way to detect angle of approach
- [ ] Maybe: Attempt autonomous finding of QR Breadcrumbs in a sterile setting

#### Week 6 - Pulling It Together

- [ ] Continue work on angle of approach issue
- [ ] Attempt autonomous finding of QR Breadcrumbs in a sterile setting

#### Week 7 - Generating QR Breadcrumbs

- [ ] Implement a way to generate a series of QR Codes based on straight paths
- [ ] Implement Eulerian Path Algorithm

#### Week 8 - Testing Rough Solution

- [ ] Find bugs or issues with the current solution before committing to making the front end application

#### Week 9 - The Front End

- [ ] Research drawing in iOS and finding a line of best fit to create room diagrams
- [ ] Hook in travel line into Eulerian Path Algorithm
- [ ] Maybe: Generate PDF of QR Breadcrumbs

#### Week 10 - The Front End Continued,  Bug Checking

- [ ] Implement a way to generate QR Breadcrumbs on sheets of paper for printing
- [ ] Test and find bugs in the front end

#### Week 11 - Pulling It Together

- [ ] Implement a way to store data on the iPhone
- [ ] Integrate fully the computational backend to the front end solution (Should be fairly bug-free by this point)

#### Week 12 - Result Output

- [ ] Run plenty of tests, continue fixing bugs
- [ ] Begin work on generating an output document of power levels and other metrics

#### Week 13+ - Testing, Testing, Testing

* Finish anything left undone
* Temper and test current solution
* Begin release cycle on Test Flight

### iPhone App Goals

- [ ] Use machine vision to find QR Breadcrumbs and angle of approach
- [ ] Interface with the `Roomba Control` classes already written
- [ ] Allow the user to draw the rough boundaries and path the robot is to follow
- [ ] Generate printable QR Codes based on the computations of the path
- [ ] Allow support for recording power levels of mmWaves through the path
- [ ] Generate a pretty output with this data graphed on a schematic of the room

### Working Times
Saturdays at 1PM, each week
